experiences:
    - role: Math Research Assistant
      time: August 2016- December 2016
      company: Williams College, Williamstown
      details: |
        - Studied many fractals and observed their dimensional properties through Mathematica.
        - Used L-systems to visualize the effect that angles and number of iterations had on
        fractals like Serpinski’s Triangle, the Koch Fractal, and fractal plants.
    - role: Cognitive Science Research Assistant
      time: June 2018- Present
      company: Williams College, Williamstown
      details: |
          - Programmed online psychology experiments and recorded participants’ performance
          through Amazon Turk in order to observe learning advantages and disadvantages in
          categorization tasks.
          - Analyzed the data obtained from these experiments in R, and presented the
          research findings to peers through simple and concise visuals.
          - Currently analyzing the efficacy of categorical learning when presented with
          high-within-category similarity by developing and running more experiments.
    - role: Systems Teaching Assistant
      time: August 2018 - December 2018
      company: Williams College, Williamstown
      details: |
          - Provided help in the Computer Systems and Organization core course by explaining
          intuition behind the programming assignments, debugging code, clarifying the
          course material, and assisting peers in writing proofs.
    - role: REU Researcher
      time: May 2019 - August 2019
      company: Washington University, St Louis
      details: |
          - Developed an online platform that visualizes over 3,000 restaurants in
          Toronto by establishing fast communication between the backend (Django)
          and frontend (Boostrap-React).
          - Made inferences on what restaurants users were likely to click on next
          through Bayesian models and updated summary statistics on the map based
          on these inferences.
          - Presented a poster that summarizes the work I contributed this summer,
          explaining a high level overview of the implementation, machine learning
          technique, and future directions for the project.
    - role: Theory Teaching Assistant
      time: August 2019 - Present
      company: Williams College, Williamstown
      details: |
          - Clarifying subjects for Theory of Computation by explaining intuition
          behind different models of computation, the languages these models generate,
          NP hardness, and the halting problem, as well as assisting in proof writing
          and programming assignments.
projects:
    title: Projects
    intro: I love to create projects for things I'm curious about. The lyrics web scraper to analyze some trends I was curious about regarding popularity of songs, and made the other web scraper to help me download course material for future review and learning, if I haven't taken the class yet. The fractals project lets me create new fractals interactively, and this made my freshman year research much easier to visualize and intuit. Lava is a project some friends and I are currently working on, and my github contains more projects I'm currently invested in, including a graph-oriented note taking app, social media platform, and multiplayer card game. 
    assignments:
      - title: Genius Lyrics WebScraper
        link: "GeniusCrawler"
        tagline: "This webscraper keeps track of the frequency of each word, in all the songs provided in a csv file, and two csv files are written to the current directory: one has the 15 most frequent words, and each word's frequency in all the songs; the other has the 15 most frequent words after filtering out stop words, and each word's frequency in all the songs"

      - title: Lava
        link: "Lava"
        tagline: "A preliminary laundry app that takes laundry requests from clients and allocates a request to a provider. Updates pending, as we are now focusing on the web implementation."

      - title: Fractals
        link: "Fractals"
        tagline: "Interactive fractal generator that uses L-systems to generate fractals. It takes in a starting axiom, production rules, number of iterations, and an angle as parameters, but if you'd like to add your own L-system you can easily do so by modifying an associated csv file."

      - title: Course WebScraper
        link: "PdfCrawler"
        tagline: "A webscraper that downloads all pdfs (and tex files, if desired) in a website. I use this to download lectures and assignments, but it can be used for other websites as well."
        
      - title: PsiTurk
        link: "Psiturk"
        tagline: "Two psychology experiments that test for the benefits of interleaved blocked studying. One uses original stimuli found in Goldstone and Carvalho's 2015 paper, and the other uses Safa Zaki's stimuli, drawn with D3."
