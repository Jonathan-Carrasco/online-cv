experiences:
    - role: Math Research Assistant
      time: August 2016- December 2016
      company: Williams College, Williamstown
      details: |
        - Studied dimensional properties of various types of fractals and used L-systems 
        to visualize the effect that  parameters like angles and number of iterations had 
        on the development of these fractals.
        - Implemented an interactive fractal drawer in Python that facilitates fractal 
        generation, given production rules formatted in a CSV file.
    - role: Cognitive Science Research Assistant
      time: June 2018- May 2019
      company: Williams College, Williamstown
      details: |
          - Read some literature on learning advantages and disadvantages in categorization tasks,
          specifically with passive/active learning in interleaved/blocked segments, and developed 
          online experiments that aimed to test the interaction between these variables.
          - Interpreted hundreds of data points obtained from these experiments using R and presented
          the research findings to peers through simple and concise visuals.
          - Analyzed the effects high-within-category similarity objects had on categorical 
          learning after creating more experiments and analyzing more data.
    - role: Systems Teaching Assistant
      time: August 2018 - December 2018
      company: Williams College, Williamstown
      details: |
          - Provided help in the Computer Systems and Organization core course (CS 237) by explaining
          intuition behind the programming assignments, debugging code, clarifying the
          course material, and assisting peers in writing proofs.
    - role: REU Researcher
      time: May 2019 - August 2019
      company: Washington University, St Louis
      details: |
          - Developed an online platform that visualizes over 3,000 restaurants in
          Toronto by establishing fast communication between the backend (Django)
          and frontend (Boostrap-React).
          - Made inferences on what restaurants users were likely to click on next
          through Bayesian models and updated summary statistics on the map based
          on these inferences.
          - Presented a poster that summarizes the work I contributed this summer,
          explaining a high level overview of the implementation, the machine learning
          technique, and future directions for the project.
    - role: Theory of Computation Teaching Assistant
      time: August 2019 - December 2019
      company: Williams College, Williamstown
      details: |
          - Clarified course material for students in the Theory of Computation core course (CS 361) by explaining the intuition
          behind different models of computation, the languages these models generate,
          NP hardness, and the halting problem. Also assisted in proof writing
          and programming assignments.
    - role: Algorithms Teaching Assistant
      time: January 2020 - Present
      company: Williams College, Williamstown
      details: |
          - Currently guiding students towards the best proof writing methods given the variety of topics explored in this core
          course(CS 256), including: induction, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, approximation schemes, 
          randomization algorithms, and network flow algorithms.
    
projects:
    title: Projects
    intro: I love working on challenging, interesting projects. I’ve mainly chosen to work on projects outside of my regular coursework that relate to my passions, like music, or help increase the efficiency of tasks I’d otherwise need to perform manually. The lyrics web scraper analyzes trends I was curious about in popular songs. The other web scraper downloads course material from any class website for future review and learning. The fractals project lets me create new fractals interactively-- this made my freshman year research much easier to visualize and intuit. Lava is a project some friends and I are currently working on, and my github contains more projects I'm currently invested in, including a graph-oriented note taking app, social media platform, and multiplayer card game assignments.

      - title: Genius Lyrics Crawler
        link: "GeniusCrawler"
        tagline: "This webscraper keeps track of the frequency of each word, in all the songs provided in a csv file, and two csv files are written to the current directory: one has the 15 most frequent words, and each word's frequency in all the songs; the other has the 15 most frequent words after filtering out stop words, and each word's frequency in all the songs"

      - title: Lava
        link: "Lava"
        tagline: "A preliminary laundry app that takes laundry requests from clients and allocates a request to a provider. Updates pending, as we are now focusing on the web implementation."

      - title: Fractals
        link: "Fractals"
        tagline: " An interactive fractal generator that uses L-systems to generate fractals. It takes in a starting axiom, the production rules, the number of iterations, and an angle as parameters, but if you'd like to add your own L-system, you can easily do so by modifying an associated csv file."

      - title: Course WebScraper
        link: "CourseCrawler"
        tagline: "A webscraper that downloads all pdfs (and other files like tex, csv, etc if desired) in a website. I use this to download lectures and assignments, but it can be used for other websites as well."
        
      - title: PsiTurk
        link: "Psiturk"
        tagline: "Two psychology experiments that test for the benefits of interleaved blocked studying. One uses original stimuli found in Goldstone and Carvalho's 2015 paper, and the other uses Safa Zaki's stimuli, drawn with D3.js."
        
      - title: Restaurants
        link: "Restaurants"
        tagline: "An online platform that maps over 3000 restaurants in Toronto and infers what restaurants users are likely to click next using bayesian models. Given these inferences, desirable restaurants are highlighted and undesirable restaurants are omitted."
