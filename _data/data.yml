          and frontend (Boostrap-React).
          - Made inferences on what restaurants users were likely to click on next
          through Bayesian models and updated summary statistics on the map based 
          on these inferences.
          - Presented a poster that summarizes the work I contributed this summer, 
          explaining a high level overview of the implementation, machine learning 
          technique, and future directions for the project.
    - role: Theory Teaching Assistant
